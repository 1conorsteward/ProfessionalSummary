As a software developer, I have demonstrated a varied range of skills through the practical enhancement of two significant projects: an Investment Calculator in C++ and an Android application called Appointment Now in Java.

Programming Languages and Frameworks:
 Proficient in C++ and Java (Android)
 | Experienced in Android app development and SQLite database management

Software Design and Architecture:
 Implemented modular design principles in both C++ and Android projects
 | Utilized object-oriented programming concepts, including constructor overloading
 | Designed and implemented complex algorithms for financial calculations

Database Management:
 Skilled in SQLite database design and optimization
 | Implemented foreign key constraints, views, indices, and triggers
 | Proficient in CRUD operations and data integrity maintenance

User Interface Design:
 Created intuitive and user-friendly interfaces for both desktop and mobile applications
 | Implemented interactive UI components such as dialogs and date pickers

Problem-Solving and Enhancement:
 Demonstrated ability to identify areas for improvement in existing software
 | Successfully enhanced applications with new features while maintaining core functionality
 | Implemented complex financial calculation algorithms in C++
 | Added critical features to an Android app, including user-specific data views and PDF export functionality

Software Development Practices:
 Practiced effective code refactoring to improve maintainability and performance
 | Implemented proper resource management and lifecycle handling in Android
 | Utilized version control systems for managing code changes
 | Wrote comprehensive documentation, including detailed README files and code comments

Security and Compliance:
 Implemented secure user authentication and session management
 | Ensured HIPAA compliance in healthcare-related application features
 | Developed a security mindset to anticipate and mitigate potential vulnerabilities
 | Collaboration and Communication
 | Created well-structured and commented code to facilitate team collaboration
 | Developed clear and concise technical documentation for end-users and developers
 | Demonstrated adaptability in project planning and implementation

Through these enhancements, I have showcased my ability to work with diverse technologies, solve complex problems, and deliver valuable solutions that meet industry-specific goals. My experience spans from financial software development to healthcare application enhancements, demonstrating versatility and a commitment to continuous learning and improvement in the field of software development. Through the demonsration of these skills I have met the course outcomes.

Employ strategies for building collaborative environments:
 The enhancements to both the Investment Calculator and Appointment Now application demonstrate this outcome. In the Investment Calculator, thorough commenting and modular design create a program that can be easily utilized and enhanced by others. For Appointment Now, the integration of modular components like AddEventDialogFragment facilitates better collaboration among team members, allowing different developers to work on specific features independently while maintaining consistency across the app.

Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality communications:
 Both artifacts showcase this outcome. The Investment Calculator's README file explains in detail the new and old strategies, input parameters, and program execution instructions. For Appointment Now, the use of detailed, clear, and well-structured code comments, along with appropriate logging and error messages, improves communication within the codebase, making it more accessible to other developers or maintainers.

Design and evaluate computing solutions:
 This outcome is strongly demonstrated in both artifacts. The Investment Calculator employs complex algorithms and overloading methods to solve investment calculation problems. In Appointment Now, the refactoring of event save and update functionality solved a key problem in the event creation/editing process, improving data passing between fragments and activities and applying sound algorithmic principles.

Demonstrate ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques:
 Both artifacts show this outcome. The Investment Calculator utilizes higher-level C++ tools like overloading, while creating custom code for its specific needs. Appointment Now demonstrates the use of SQLite for local data storage, handling PDF uploads, and integrating user-friendly UI components, showcasing innovative techniques in Android development.
 
Develop a security mindset:
 While the Investment Calculator doesn't strongly address this outcome due to its nature, Appointment Now significantly demonstrates it. The app uses SharedPreferences to securely manage user sessions and handle permissions, reflecting consideration for data privacy and security. The refactoring to close database connections enhances security by reducing potential vulnerabilities. Input validation ensures that user-provided data is properly sanitized, mitigating potential injection attacks or other adversarial exploits.
